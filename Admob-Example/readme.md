# How to use Google's Admob with Onsen

Download and install this plugin:  https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro

Include and edit the admob.js file.

That's it!

Obviously, if you want different ads, then you need to follow the plugins documentation for that.

On line 31, you can change isTesting to True and that will allow you to test your ads without issue on Admobs side.
